- R (optional): lavaan, semTools (for ordinal CFA using WLSMV)

## Reproducibility
1. Open `notebooks/analysis_colab.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Run cells in order to reproduce descriptive statistics, reliability, CFA, HTMT, and mediation analyses.

## Data and ethics
The dataset shared here is anonymised and does not contain direct identifiers. Any potentially identifying free-text fields were excluded.
